Incomplete tasks:
1.pipeline with forwarding fro sekections srt is giving wrong output.
Everything was working untill we noticed that bubble and selection sort were taking the same inputs just the night before the deadline so it has bugs which werent all resolved.
Terminal doesn't show output for both the cores because we are also printing latch contents (space constraint)
Every other requirement is met for phase 2 and phase 3.
