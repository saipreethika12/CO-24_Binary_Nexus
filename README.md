Decisions:Again tried on la, changed the data type of RAM from int to char, so that int is stored as four bytes..,the value in the four bytes is concatinated and converted to int while loading the address or word..implemented selection sort..finally seen that same memory is used for both the cores.

Decisions:Worked on implementation of la , we were trying to load addresses from the memory into the register..but didn't work and went with lw instead for storing the base address of the array and implemented bubble sort.<br>
