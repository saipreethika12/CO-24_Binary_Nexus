Members:Ikshitha,Preethika
Decisions:Implemented SIMD unit, cleaned the code.
Date:10-5-24<br>
Members:Ikshitha,Preethika
Decisions:Debug for L2,was unable to solve the problem hence reverted back to TBP.Worked on implementation of SIMD unit.
Date:9-5-24<br>
Members:Ikshitha,Preethika
Decisions: Encorporated an L2 cache(non-inclusive).Worked on debugging as the number of cycles were wrong.
Date:8-5-24<br>
Members:Ikshitha,Preethika
Decisions: Decided for the implentation of TBP,L2 level cache ans SIMD unit.Implemented TBP.

Decisions:Debugging, Implementation considering memory access for instruction fetch 
Date:4-4-24<br>
Members:Ikshitha,Preethika<br>
Decisions:Implemented cache replacment policies,encorporated cache in pipeling
Date:3-4-24<br>
Members:Ikshitha,Preethika<br>
Decisions:Configured cache class <br>
Date:31-3-24<br>
Members:Ikshitha,Preethika<br>
Decisions:Set input file for cache_config<br>

Members:Ikshitha,Preethika<br>
Decisions:Again tried on la, changed the data type of RAM from int to char, so that int is stored as four bytes..,the value in the four bytes is concatinated and converted to int while loading the address or word..implemented selection sort..finally seen that same memory is used for both the cores.

Members:Ikshitha,Preethika<br>
Decisions:Worked on implementation of la , we were trying to load addresses from the memory into the register..but didn't work and went with lw instead for storing the base address of the array and implemented bubble sort.<br>  
Date:21-2-24<br>
Members:Ikshitha,Preethika<br>
Decisions:Updated prilimnary instructions,implemented jal,jalr,labels, branch instructions<br>
